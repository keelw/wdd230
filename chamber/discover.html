            <p class="caption">Herriman is a beatufiul city located on the southwest bench of the Salt Lake Valley. The 
                city extends from the southern border of South Jordan to the far end of Salt Lake County. It is a 
                beatufiul city that backs right up to the mountains.

            <p class="caption">On the east, the entire Salt Lake valley can be seen, including the stunning mountains 
                that Utah is famous for.

            <p class="caption">20 years ago, Herriman was far disconnected from Salt Lake and was much more 
                rural than it is now. The expansion of the I-15 freeway, Bangerter HWY, and Mtn View Corridors 
                have made Herriman connected to the rest of the valley to it's north and Utah valley to it's 
                South.

            <p class="caption">Although Herriman is a buzzing location for growing businesses and retail centers, 
                there is still something rustic about it that also makes it a destination away from the large city 
                centers of Salt Lake, Draper, Sandy, and West Jordan. There are fishing lakes and hiking trails 
                riddled around the city.

            <p class="caption">The retail sector of Herriman, and nearby Riverton, have also been growing rapidly to match the
